/* Pretend you are writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items:
   health potions, torches, and arrows. Create (i) an enum to identify the different
   types of items and (ii) a using a built-in fixed array, store the number of each 
   item the player is carrying. The player should start with 2 health potions,
   5 torches, and 10 arrows. (iii) Write a function called countTotalItems() that 
   returns how many items the player has in total and have the main function print it.*/
